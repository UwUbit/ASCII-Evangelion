# Bad Apple in terminal using Python

I have accidentally stumbled upon a GitHub profile of my dear friend, [Koteikar](https://github.com/Koteikar). Purely for fun,
I decided to make a fork of his project and make my own thing based on this [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/oh0RQ_TgDnQ?si=SK5zS0XawRZSfmOp).
Also, please check the original work of my friend here -> [Repository](https://github.com/Koteikar/Bad-Apple),
as well as his [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/ikyKLfB4cfg) on YouTube.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this project you'll need to install these packages:
* opencv-python
* fpstimer
* playsound

### Installing packages

To install these packages you need to write these commands in console:

```
pip install opencv-python
```
```
pip install fpstimer
```
```
pip install playsound==1.2.2
```
Alternatively you can set your terminal to the directory of this repository and simply paste this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Size of a window

The code supports any size of a window, but if you want to run it in full screen,
make sure that the size of a text is set to 100%, or image WILL be asymmetric.
To check the size of the text you need to go to settings > system > display > change the size of text.
